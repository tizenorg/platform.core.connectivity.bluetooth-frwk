Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.  The complexity scale is exponential,
  with complexity 1 being the lowest complexity.  Complexity is a function
  of both task 'complexity' and task 'scope'.

  The general rule of thumb is that a complexity 1 task should take 1-2 weeks
  for a person very familiar with BlueZ codebase.  Higher complexity tasks
  require more time and have higher uncertainty.

  Higher complexity tasks should be refined into several lower complexity tasks
  once the task is better understood.

General
==========

- Socket CAPI modification: the current CAPIs of socket don't match Bluez5.X.
  NTB implemented the temporary solution to match the current CAPIs.
  in the long term, we need to redesgin the socket CAPIs of socket to match
  the interfaces of Bluez5.X.

  Priority: low
  Complexity: C2
