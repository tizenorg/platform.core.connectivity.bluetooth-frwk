<h1>Bluetooth Framework Architecture</h1>
	<h2 class="pg">Architecture overview</h2>
@image html bluetooth_image001.png

<h1>Bluetooth Framework Features</h1>
The Bluetooth API exposes a high level interface that is used by applications.

Bluetooth API currently provides 3 kinds of APIs.
@n GAP APIs: These APIs are used to perform operations related to the local device such as set device name, set visibility mode etc. It also exposes APIs to perform basic Bluetooth related operations like device search
@n SDP APIs: These APIs are used to search service list supported by a specific device. A record in the service list gives a description of a service supported by the device. Specific records having a service ID assigned by Bluetooth SIG give a exact information of predefined service roles.
@n RFCOMM APIs: In order to establish a serial connection between two Bluetooth devices, this SDK provides simple RFCOMM APIs. After receiving FD from SDK, developer can use regular system functions like read() write() poll() select() etc to send or receive data.

Bluetooth can be shared among several applications, and the Bluetooth framework will supervise some of the important functionalities like pairing, configuration, and authorization. These functions will be confirmed by the user with use of a Bluetooth agent daemon.

<h1>Using Bluetooth API</h1>
You can use Bluetooth API to communication with other Bluetooth enabled device (mobile phone, PC etc) over RFCOMM interface. This SDK provides supporting Device management functions to find the device you want to connect with. You can refer to the following use cases as examples for writing your own Bluetooth based application.

	<h2 class="pg">Listening for events</h2>
In general, Bluetooth API provided to you is asynchronous in nature. Hence it becomes mandatory for Application to listen for the events which may be sent by Bluetooth API as per the data received. An application developer can call bluetooth_register_callback() function to register a callback function of bluetooth_cb_func_ptr type. This registered function will receive events of bluetooth_event_type_t type along with any any data.

	<h2 class="pg">Managing Adapter</h2>
Bluetooth Adaptor represents the Bluetooth Chip present in your device. The bluetooth_enable_adapter() API can be used to activate Bluetooth. This API sends a request to Bluetooth chip for activation. This will also initialize Bluetooth adaptor. Upon completion of the procedure, it will send BLUETOOTH_EVENT_ENABLED event. Bluetooth adapter should be disabled to switch off Bluetooth chip (and thereby saving power). bluetooth_disable_adapter() function will do that job for you. After switching off Bluetooth, BLUETOOTH_EVENT_DISABLED will be sent by SDK to application for confirmation.

	<h2 class="pg">Getting local device information</h2>
Every Bluetooth device has a unique 48 bit address assigned to it. You can read your Bluetooth device's address by using bluetooth_get_local_address() API. It is a synchronous function call. In its output parameter, you can receive bluetooth_device_address_t type of pointer which will contain Bluetooth address. Since its inconvenient for user to remember the address, Bluetooth provides a method to have a friendly name for each device. You can get or set the device name by bluetooth_get_local_name() and bluetooth_set_local_name() respectively. If you set the name, BLUETOOTH_EVENT_LOCAL_NAME_CHANGED event will be sent to application to inform result of requested operation. As per Bluetooth standard, maximum length of device name can be BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_NAME_MAX_LENGTH or 248 bytes. It should be in UTF-8 format.

In order to be discoverable to other devices, your Bluetooth device should respond to inquiry scan requests. You can retrieve the mode of your device by calling bluetooth_get_discoverable_mode() API. It is a synchronous API which will give you current mode in bluetooth_discoverable_mode_t format. You can choose from the four different modes: connectable only (non discoverable), general discoverable, time limited discoverable (discoverable for limited time duration) and limited discoverable.

	<h2 class="pg">Searching for peer Bluetooth device</h2>
You can search for peer Bluetooth devices using the bluetooth_start_discovery() API. It is an asynchronous function call. You can receive the BLUETOOTH_EVENT_DISCOVERY_STARTED event when any discovery session is successfully started from the target, even if your application does not request discovery. After the opened discovery session is closed, you will get the BLUETOOTH_EVENT_DISCOVERY_FINISHED event. During the discovery session, you can get several BLUETOOTH_EVENT_REMOTE_DEVICE_FOUND events and BLUETOOTH_EVENT_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME_UPDATED events. The former event gives information of a device without its name and the latter event includes a friendly name for the device, and is delivered after the former event. The latter event can be delivered more than once for a device.
@n Since only one discovery session is permitted at a time, a discovery request will return failure if there is a session already open.

	<h2 class="pg">Serial communication in wireless way</h2>
There are two roles in serial communication. One is server role which is waiting a connection from another device. The other role is client role which initiates a connection. For serial communication between your application in two targets.
@n At first you should open server in one device. It can be done with bluetooth_rfcomm_create_socket() API and bluetooth_rfcomm_listen_and_accept() API. You can get a server socket file descriptor with the first API and can start waiting with the second API.
@n At next, client device can connect with a waiting server with bluetooth_rfcomm_remote_connect() API. When a client is successfully connected with a server, you will receive the device node path for serial connection. With opening this path you can communicate with server device by reading and writing it.
@n You should match UUID string with a server. You can use a UUID predefined by Bluetooth SIG if you want to use a specific Bluetooth profile role. Otherwise you should use your own UUID with 128bits hexa value formatted as like "#######-####-####-####-############" Format of Bluetooth SIG predefined UUID is "000####-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB"

	<h2 class="pg">Tips & Tricks</h2>
You can connect with PC having Bluetooth adapter with Serial Port emulation Profile. For this, you should use SPP UUID string, "0001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB" If the serial connection is established, you can use a serial port in PC side for communicating with your application in a device.
